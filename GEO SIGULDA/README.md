# GEO SIGULDA

Place for interactive web maps of Sigulda Municipality, offering a clearer way to explore and understand location-based information. Data that can be difficult to interpret in a list or spreadsheet becomes much more accessible when visualised on a map. Viewing information in its geographical context makes it easier to spot patterns, relationships, and relevance that might otherwise be overlooked. The maps are built using mobile-friendly React Leaflet, providing a faster and more responsive experience compared to solutions like ArcGIS Online. This approach prioritises speed and usability in web mapping.
