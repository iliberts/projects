# GEO SIGULDA

The website serves as a portal for publishing interactive web maps of Sigulda Municipality, providing an intuitive way to explore location-based information. Traditionally, such data—whether presented in a list or spreadsheet format—can be difficult to interpret and navigate. By visualising this information on an interactive map, users can easily understand spatial relationships and gain valuable insights. The maps are built using mobile-friendly React Leaflet, offering a faster and more responsive experience compared to solutions like ArcGIS Online, which can be slower and less accessible on mobile devices. This approach ensures that users can efficiently explore the data from any device, enhancing both usability and accessibility.
