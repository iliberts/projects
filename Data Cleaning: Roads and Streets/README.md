# Data Cleaning: Roads and Streets

This project processes the list of roads and streets maintained by Sigulda Municipality, which is divided across four Excel worksheets: A roads, B roads, C roads, and Streets. Each worksheet contains multiple tables with headings and summaries, structured in a hierarchical format, where roads and streets are grouped by territorial divisions. Many of these roads and streets are further divided into sections, with the name provided only for the first section.

All data is consolidated into a single table. Territorial divisions are extracted into a separate column, branch sections are identified, and each road or street is assigned a unique ID, as names may be repeated.
