# School Bus Routes with Real-time Tracking for Sigulda Municipality

This web app provides an interactive map designed to help make sense of school bus routes. Unlike public transport networks, school buses are meant to get pupils to and from specific schools, so showing the full network isnâ€™t as useful. Instead, the app focuses on giving clear information about which buses stop where, what time they arrive, and which schools they go to. Individual routes can be selected to see its full path, stops, and direction of travel, making it easy to understand how each bus runs and where it goes. During service hours, the app also provides real-time tracking based on live GPS data from the buses, meaning the map reflects their actual positions rather than estimated movements from the schedule.

Developed in TypeScript using React and React-Leaflet.
